## Overview
This challenge required creating a responsive product preview card that changed images when the viewport width changed.

## My process
I followed the suggested path and began with the mobile first workflow. Beginning with the HTML code and then adding styles in CSS. Finally, I added responsive design changes with @media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to change an image, and change the layout of the design based on screen size. This final step was challenging, since I didn't realize there was a different image at first. Once I added code to change the image, everything worked.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue practicing creating designs using different style elements and making them responsive. Completing more designs that require more complex changes relative to screen size will help me to hone my skills.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site continues to be a helpful resource for me. I use it as a reference to remember different properties and how they are defined in CSS.
- [Google] - General google searches helped me to solve other issues I encountered.
